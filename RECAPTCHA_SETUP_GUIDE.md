# reCAPTCHA Setup Guide for Heartland Heating + Air

## Overview

The Heartland Heating + Air website has reCAPTCHA integration implemented in two forms:

1. **Contact Form** - Main quote request form
2. **Job Application Forms** - Individual job posting application forms

Both forms are currently using placeholder site keys and need to be configured with real reCAPTCHA keys.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **What's Already Implemented:**

- reCAPTCHA widgets in both forms
- Client-side validation
- Server-side verification (in server.js)
- Error handling and user feedback
- Form submission blocking until reCAPTCHA is completed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **What Needs to be Done:**

- Get real reCAPTCHA site keys from Google
- Replace placeholder keys in the code
- Test the integration

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### 1. Get reCAPTCHA Keys from Google

1. **Go to Google reCAPTCHA Admin Console:**

   - Visit: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Create a new site:**

   - Click "Create" or "+" button
   - Choose "reCAPTCHA v2"
   - Select "I'm not a robot" Checkbox

3. **Configure the site:**

   - **Label:** "Heartland Heating + Air"
   - **Domains:** Add your domains:
     - `localhost` (for development)
     - `heartlandheatingair.com` (production)
     - `www.heartlandheatingair.com` (production)
   - **Accept the terms of service**

4. **Get your keys:**
   - **Site Key:** Copy this key (starts with `6L...`)
   - **Secret Key:** Copy this key (starts with `6L...`)

### 2. Update the Code

#### A. Update Contact Form reCAPTCHA

**File:** `public/components/Contact.js`
**Line:** ~175

Replace:

```html
<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="YOUR_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY_HERE"></div>
```

With:

```html
<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="YOUR_ACTUAL_SITE_KEY"></div>
```

#### B. Update Job Application Form reCAPTCHA

**File:** `public/components/JobDetail.js`
**Line:** ~158

Replace:

```html
<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="YOUR_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY_HERE"></div>
```

With:

```html
<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="YOUR_ACTUAL_SITE_KEY"></div>
```

#### C. Update Server-Side Secret Key

**File:** `server.js`
**Line:** ~15

Replace:

```javascript
body: `secret=${process.env.RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY}&response=${recaptchaResponse}`;
```

Make sure your `.env` file contains:

```
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_actual_secret_key_here
```

### 3. Test the Integration

#### A. Test Contact Form

1. Visit the contact page
2. Fill out the form
3. Complete the reCAPTCHA
4. Submit the form
5. Check that the form submits successfully

- Ensure the domain is added to reCAPTCHA admin console

#### Form Not Submitting

- Check that reCAPTCHA is completed
- Verify server-side validation is working
- Check server logs for errors
- Ensure secret key is correct in environment variables

#### reCAPTCHA Validation Failing

- Test with different browsers/devices
- Check for JavaScript errors

## Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ **Implemented:**

- Client-side validation before form submission
- Server-side verification of reCAPTCHA response
- Form submission blocking until reCAPTCHA is completed
